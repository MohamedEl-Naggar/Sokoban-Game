# Sokoban-Game
The project consists of only 5 levels. However, you can add as many levels as you want using a notepad by creating a matrix of numbers which has a maximum of 12x12 numbers using the following critera: 0 -> player, 1 -> brick, 2 -> box, 3 -> destination, 4-> floor, 5 -> space.
Also, all the sprites used in the game are compressed together in the images.rar file.
